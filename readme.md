# Tube disruption calendar

A repository for experimenting with the TFL API.  The idea is to use it to produce an ics calendar of planned disruption on a specified tube line or on the Overground, suitable for importing into Google Calendar or similar.

According to [this Medium post from 2016](https://medium.com/@ed.sparkes/a-tube-planned-works-calendar-91c7a483c3c4) there used to be a similar service available at [tubecal.uk](http://tubecal.uk/) but it seems to be dead now.
